# Assignment Problem Set

1. A store owner wants to calculate the total items' cost in a customer's shopping cart. Write a program that asks the user to input the prices and quantities of different items in the cart, and then calculate the total cost.

2. Take any letter input through the keyboard. Write a program to find out whether it is a vowel or a consonant. For non-alphabet inputs, the output will be “Not a character” (Using If-else and switch case).

3. Take any 4 integer numbers into 4 variables that are input through the keyboard. Write a program to find out the 2nd smallest number among 4 numbers. (Using If-else)

4. Write a program that calculates the sum of the first n terms of the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n. The program should ask the user to enter the value of n, and then use a loop to calculate the sum.

5. Create an array to store 5 years by taking inputs from the user. Now, develop a program that checks each year present in the array to determine if the year is a leap year and prints only the leap years from the array.

6. Write a C++ program to draw the following pattern for the input n.  
   **Hint:** nested loop  

   **Input:**  
   Enter a number: 3  

   **Output:**  
   ```
   1
   1 2
   1 2 3
   ```

7. Write a C++ program to reverse a number.  
   **Sample Input:** 45819  
   **Sample Output:** 91854  

8. Suppose your ID is 24-58316-2. Use the middle part of your ID and draw the pattern as follows.  
   **Hint:** Store the ID into an array. You can not use hard-coded value for iteration - use loop and conditional statements.  

   **Output:**  
   ```
   5
   5 8
   5 8 3
   5 8 3 1
   5 8 3 1 6
   ```
