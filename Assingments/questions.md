# Assignment Problem Set

1. A store owner wants to calculate the total items' cost in a customer's shopping cart. Write a program that asks the user to input the prices and quantities of different items in the cart, and then calculate the total cost.

2. Take any letter input through the keyboard. Write a program to find out whether it is a vowel or a consonant. For non-alphabet inputs, the output will be “Not a character” (Using If-else and switch case).

3. Take any 4 integer numbers into 4 variables that are input through the keyboard. Write a program to find out the 2nd smallest number among 4 numbers. (Using If-else)

4. Write a program that calculates the sum of the first n terms of the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n. The program should ask the user to enter the value of n, and then use a loop to calculate the sum.

5. Create an array to store 5 years by taking inputs from the user. Now, develop a program that checks each year present in the array to determine if the year is a leap year and prints only the leap years from the array.

6. Write a C++ program to draw the following pattern for the input n.  
   **Hint:** nested loop

   **Input:**  
   Enter a number: 3

   **Output:**

   ```
   1
   1 2
   1 2 3
   ```

7. Write a C++ program to reverse a number.

   ```
   **Sample Input:** 45819
   **Sample Output:** 91854
   ```

8. Suppose your ID is 24-58316-2. Use the middle part of your ID and draw the pattern as follows.  
   **Hint:** Store the ID into an array. You can not use hard-coded value for iteration - use loop and conditional statements.

   **Output:**

   ```
   5
   5 8
   5 8 3
   5 8 3 1
   5 8 3 1 6
   ```

9. Write a program in C++ to take a year as input. Consider, User’s given year is smaller than the Current_Year = 2024. Now, print all the leap years observed from user’s given year to Current_Year.

10. Write a program in C++ to Reverse an Integer Number that will only contain the odd digits.

    **Sample output:**

```
Enter an Integer Number: 123456
Reverse of the Odd Digit Integer: 53
```

10. Write a program in C++ to take a positive number N as input and print all possible perfect numbers and total count for 1 to N. [Hint: a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive proper divisors, that is, divisors ex-cluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has proper divisors 1, 2 and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number. The next perfect number is 28, since 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.]

**Sample output:**

```
Enter an Integer Number: 1000
Perfect Number from 1 to 1000 are:
6
28
496
Total Count of Perfect Number: 3
```

11. Write a program in C++ use array to take N students quiz_1[N] and quiz_2[N] marks as input. After that find the worst quiz marks from two quizzes and save results on worst_quiz[N] array and show the results.

**_Sample output:_**

```
Number of Students: 4
Quiz-1 Marks:
14
25.5
28
10
Quiz-2 Marks:
20
27
26
18
Worst Quizzes: 14 25.5 26 10
```
