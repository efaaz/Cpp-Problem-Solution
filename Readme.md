# C++ Problem & Solutions

Welcome to this repository! Here you'll find a collection of C++ problems and their solutions, organized by topic to help you learn and practice key programming concepts. Each topic folder contains multiple problems, along with their solutions, to help you build your C++ skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into folders, with each folder representing a different topic. Within each folder, there are files for each problem:
- **Problem Description**: `.md` file containing the problem statement and any relevant information.
- **Solution Code**: `.cpp` file with the C++ code for solving the problem.

## Topics Covered

- **If-Else**: Basic conditional statements with up to 10 problems.
- **Arrays**: Array manipulations and operations.
- **Loops**: For, while, and do-while loops to practice iteration.
- **Functions**: Using and defining functions in C++.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Select a Topic**: Navigate to one of the topic folders (like `If_Else`, `Arrays`, `Loops`, or `Functions`).
2. **Choose a Problem**: Each problem is numbered (e.g., `Problem1.md`, `Problem1.cpp`), so you can go through them in sequence.
3. **Read the Problem**: Open the `.md` file for a problem to read the description and understand the requirements.
4. **Check the Solution**: Open the corresponding `.cpp` file to see the C++ code solution.

## Example

If you want to practice with if-else conditions, go to the `If_Else` folder. You’ll find files like:

- `Problem1.md`: Contains the first if-else problem description.
- `Problem1.cpp`: Contains the solution code for the first problem.

Repeat this process for each topic to work through different problems.
